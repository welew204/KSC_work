# Solution Variants

These are some (older) solutions for previous versions of this lesson. Nothing
here should be used as reference code, since they don't use models to store
anything in the DB, making them much less useful to learn from.  However, if
you are interested to see how these activities might be done using lists and
dictionaries instead of using a database or Django's ORM, feel free to poke
around in these solutions!
