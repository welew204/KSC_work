- Activity goals:
    - NOTE: The SQL generated by these activities is pretty messy! So don't
      worry about understanding every single aspect. Instead focus on "big
      picture" understanding.
    - NOTE: This activity *DOES NOT* use Postgres, but instead the Django and
      SQLite. However, the objective is to show how the various SQL commands we
      just learned "translate" when using the Django ORM, and applies also to
      when Django uses Postgres or any other DB.

- General activity tips:
    - We'll use again the "The Book Club" project. This time, however, you
      can't run "runserver". This activity is all about the database.
    - Copy just the Python code. Don't copy the backticks "`" (that's just for
      Markdown formatting). Don't introduce extra indentation or it won't run.
    - Having technical difficulties? The solution has the example output, which
      is enough to learn concepts from, in case you truly get stuck.

- Reference code tips:
    - If it helps, feel free to leave the SQLite file open while you run them,
      to see the DB data that is getting queried.
    - If it helps, feel free to keep the models.py open so you remember what
      fields exist on each model

- Python interactive prompt tips:
    - Exit Python prompts with Ctrl+D
    - Don't get your prompts mixed-up: You can't run Bash or zsh commands while you
      are in a Python prompt, and vice-versa.
