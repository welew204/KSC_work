# Bonus Activity

## Faceboop Chat CRUD

- This is an open ended bonus activity -- no step-by-step clues available for
  this one. Being able to build CRUD operations from scratch is one of the most
  important skills to have as a back-end programmer.

- You are given the skeleton of a project, you need to add the Python code and
  make the HTML changes necessary to implement a CRUD-based chat system.


## Completed spec

- Post new posts with any username of your choice
### FINISHED read, create for this activity -WB

- The ability to delete posts

- The ability to "like" posts

- The ability to edit posts to say different things


## Tips

- Don't try working from memory! Copy from previous activities.

- Work on one thing at a time. Use SQLite DB Viewer and the admin interface to
  confirm each step is working before going to the next (solving any sort of
  "chicken and egg" problem)

- In terms of CRUD operations, usually a good ordering is:
    - Read
    - Create
    - Delete
    - Update

- To test Read before you make Create, use the Django admin interface to add
  test data, to solve this sort of "chicken and egg problem"
