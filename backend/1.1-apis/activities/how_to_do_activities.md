New to our courses? Here are some tips to get the most out of this activity,
and all others in the course:

# How to do activities

- This activity, like all other activities in this course, is divided into a
  series of challenges.

- Give yourself a time-limit: If you are following online, or in class, use the
  time suggested. Otherwise, set a 10 or 15 minute timer. Your goal is to
  finish as many challenges as you can within a certain amount of time.

- Focus first on the first challenges. Do them one at a time.

- If you run out of time -- which you probably will -- skip to the next
  activity. Later, such as the next day, set aside time to return to activities
  to review concepts at a slower pace and dive deeper.

- Remember: Focus first on breadth, then on depth. Sometimes the best thing to
  do is to move on!

# Python tips

1. Keep your text editor (such as VS Code) and terminal open in a way that's
comfortable for you to switch between them.

2. Always add a "print statement" to each file before starting: This is a
habit that can save time in the long run, since it's common to accidentally
edit the wrong file, or mess-up the way you are running it.

3. In this course we use Python 3 and Pipenv. See supplemental material on
Pipenv if you are just starting this course without knowledge of how to use it:
