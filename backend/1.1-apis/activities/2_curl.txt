1. Use curl -v to a GET request to google.com:
    curl -v google.com

2. Try using curl on other sites, compare and contrast the results.
Discuss with the person next to you, see if you can formulate in your
own words what is going on, what is being sent as a request, and what is
getting received as response.

3. Now, as before, open up any website using Google Dev tools, and go to
the networking tab. Browse around some, and, as before, see the
"requests" pop up. Right click on one of the requests and select "Copy"
and then select "Copy as cURL command" (or something similar).

4. The curl commands that Google Chrome generates are monstrous. Paste
it in, and then discuss with your partner what you think it does.

5. Add a '-v' at the end before you run it to see EVEN MORE information
about what it is doing. It will be A LOT of info, so see if you can
read through the gibberish and find relevant information within the
code.


Bonus Challenges:

1. For fun, try cURLing the following locations:
    http://wttr.in/Oakland
    http://wttr.in/Moon

2. Install an alternative cURL equivalent:
    - (GUI) Advanced REST Client is a popular GUI tool for testing HTTP
      requests:
        - <https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install>
    - (GUI) Postman and Insomnia are both a bit older and probably more
      popular, but also more complicated:
        - <https://www.getpostman.com/>
        - <https://insomnia.rest/>
    - (CLI) httpie is a CLI tool to replace cURL, with an improved and
      hopefully more user-friendly interface and syntax-highlighted
      terminal output: <https://github.com/httpie/httpiea>
