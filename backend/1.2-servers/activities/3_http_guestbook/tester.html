    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a personal trainer and nutrition coach, I
        am often asked, "What is the best workout to do for (fill in the blank: abs, legs,
        to lose weight, to get better at running, etc)." Most of the time, the person
        asking hasn\\\'t been doing much in the way of physical activity in a while. Maybe
        they have thought about getting started many times, but they get stalled out
        trying to decide WHAT to do. What will be most effective?</p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The truth of the matter is that when you are
        starting from a place of very little activity (i.e. sometimes you take the stairs
        instead of the elevator, but nothing much more strenuous than that on a consistent
        weekly basis) the specific program doesn\\\'t matter. As long as the exercise
        program you commit to \\xc2\\xa0a)\\xc2\\xa0includes functional human movements
        (i.e. task-driven, full-body),\\xc2\\xa0b)\\xc2\\xa0raises your heart

        abs and glutes),\\xc2\\xa0you\\\'ll see great results if you <em>simply stick to
            it</em>. Master the art of showing up. Three times per week. For about a year.
        That is all you need to focus on*.</p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course, if you can bring a little
        curiosity and a sense of humor with you when you show up, that will go a long way
        \\xc2\\xa0But even if you show up in a foul mood. Or sore. Or tired. It will be
        better to have done something than nothing. It is important to honor your
        limitations, and it doesn\\\'t hurt to let your coach know how your body is
        feeling on any given day so that they can adjust accordingly :).</p>
    <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What you are really doing in that first year
        of showing up is building a foundation of habit. The habit is like a mantra, in
        action: "At least 3 times per week, I dedicate time to moving my body". Carving
        out space for that in our hectic lives when we are not in the habit of doing it is
        a challenging task. There are a whole pile of things that will try to usurp the
        time you carve out for movement: work deadlines, family obligations, summer
        travel...you name it\\xe2\\x80\\x94we have run into it with our clients. The real
        task in the beginning is to consistently find that time for yourself. It will
        serve you better to show up to the gym and just move for an hour than to skip it
        all together. Why? Because it fulfills the primary goal: <strong>Show up, spend
            time moving.</strong></p>
