ACTIVITY: Hello World
-------------------------------------

**How to do activities**

- This activity, like all other activities in this course, is divided into a
  series of challenges.

- Give yourself a time-limit: If you are following online, or in class, use the
  time suggested. Otherwise, set a 10 or 15 minute timer. Your goal is to
  finish as many challenges as you can within a certain amount of time.

- Focus first on the first challenges. Do them one at a time.

- If you run out of time -- which you probably will -- skip to the next
  activity. Later, such as the next day, set aside time to return to activities
  to review concepts at a slower pace and dive deeper.

- Remember: Focus first on breadth, then on depth. Sometimes the best thing to
  do is to move on!


-------------------------------------



Challenge #1: Hello World
---------------------------

Background: According to a 50+ year old tradition, the first program you learn
when learning to code shows the text "Hello World". This will be your first
baby steps in the world of computer programming!


1. Bring up your preferred text-editor

2. Type in the words "Hello World" (feel free to customize this message!)

3. Save the file as `helloworld.html`

4. Open up the file in your browser
    - Locate it in your file browser (or Desktop), and double-click on it

5. Try changing the text, and seeing the results
    - Hint: You'll need to save in your text editor, and refresh in your
      browser, to see any changes you've made

Congratulations! You have written your first HTML document! It's a very
simple website, but it *is* a website, and a great start :)



Challenge #2: Hello (Bigger) World
------------------------------------

Try out the following code in your text editor:

    <h1>Hello (Bigger) World</h1>

Then, save your text editor, refresh (or re-open) the file in your browser. See
how the text is bigger? We'll get to why that is later!




Challenge #3: Hello GitHub
------------------------------------

# WB: https://welew204.github.io/improved-sniffle/

Background: As cool as your website is, it's not available for the world to
see. Instead it's just a document sitting on your computer, and no one else can
find it. For other people to be able to see your website you'll need to publish
it using a server. GitHub provides this for free (among other services).

1. Log-in to GitHub - http://github.com

2. Click the green "New Repository" button, or the plus (+) button in the
upper-right corner, and select "New Repository"

3. Pick a name for your repo, or use the silly suggested one (Rules: No spaces,
just alphanumeric and dashes)

4. Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" checkbox

5. Click the green "Create repository" button

6. In the new screen, click the "Create new file" button

7. Name the file index.html

8. Type in "Hello GitHub World" (or similar) as the contents of the
file.

9.  Scroll to the bottom and click "Commit new file". This should create
a new file. Double check that in the new screen, in addition to
README.md, you see an index.html

10. Now, click the Settings tab (to the right, under the Stars count)

11. Scroll all the way down to "GitHub Pages" (this might be far down the page)

12. Click on the "None v" dropdown button under Source, and select
"main branch"

13. The page should refresh. Now scroll down again, and you should see a
link to your newly published page (something like "Your site is ready to
be published at..."). Click this link to see your handiwork!

Hints:


- GitHub Pages can be a little glitchy, and have delays caused by "caching",
  such that it can take a few minutes for changes to take effect.

- Example:
    - Repository: https://github.com/janeqhacker/hello-github-world/
    - Published site: https://janeqhacker.github.io/hello-github-world/

- Aside: Historically (mid-2020), the "main branch" was called "master branch".
  It's possible you might still see that if you had configured GitHub previous
  to when they made change, or if you are using a company account.


Bonus Challenge: Formatting your research
-----------------------------------------

In the previous activity, you created a file called `tech_stack_research.txt`
containing information about tech stacks.

1. Copy the contents of `tech_stack_research.txt` (from a previous activity)
into your HTML file.

2. Format the title to be big, and information tech stack to be on as many
separate lines as necessary.

Hint:

    <h1>Name of Company</h1>
    <p>Languages in use: Python, JavaScript</p>
    <p>Frameworks: Django, React.js</p>
    <p>Database: PostgreSQL</p>
