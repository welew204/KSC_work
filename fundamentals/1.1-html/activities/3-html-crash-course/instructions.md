ACTIVITY: HTML Crash Course
-------------------------------------

**How to do activities**

- This activity, like all other activities in this course, is divided into a
  series of challenges.

- Give yourself a time-limit: If you are following online, or in class, use the
  time suggested. Otherwise, set a 10 or 15 minute timer. Your goal is to
  finish as many challenges as you can within a certain amount of time.

- Focus first on the first challenges. Do them one at a time.

- If you run out of time -- which you probably will -- skip to the next
  activity. Later, such as the next day, set aside time to return to activities
  to review concepts at a slower pace and dive deeper.

- Remember: Focus first on breadth, then on depth. Sometimes the best thing to
  do is to move on!



-------------------------------------



Challenge #1: Paragraphs
---------------------------

1. Open `index.html` in both your text-editor and browser

2. P-tags are required to show paragraphs. Follow the pattern you see with the
`<p>Languages in use</p>` code to use p-tags to put the other lines into
separate paragraphs.

Hint: With all challenges, and all coding in general, only make one change at a
time, and save & refresh each time.



Challenge #2: Strong
---------------------------

- The "strong" tag is for making text bold.

- Make the text proceding each colon ("Languages in use", "Frameworks", and
  "Databases") bold using strong tags




Challenge #3: Headers
---------------------------

1. Copy the following text into the index.html

2. Wrap each word in a header tag (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6), starting with
Biggest (h1) and going to Smallest (h6):


    Biggest

    Bigger

    Big

    Small

    Smaller

    Smallest




Challenge #4: Anchors (links) 
------------------------------

In HTML, links are called "anchors", and use an "a" tag. Using the "href"
attribute, we can specify where the link should go.

- Create a new paragraph with functioning links Mozilla.org and Google.com
- Come up with any text you'd like, or use the following text:


    Learn more about our technology partners: Mozilla and Google


- Stuck? Hints are included in "hints.md"





Challenge #5: Images
------------------------------

Using the "img" tag we can add images. Within the img tag, we can use the "src"
attribute, and specify where the image can be found.

- Include in your page the "fizzlogo.jpg" image (hint: src="./fizzlogo.jpg")

- Include in your page the image at the following URL, which is a simple
  drawing of a curled up cat:

    https://i.imgur.com/OxpjYZ0.png


- Hint: img tags are "self-closing", meaning they don't need a closing tag.



Challenge #6: Unordered list
------------------------------

Create an unordered list (bullet point list) containing the following:

    We provided the Fizziest Cloud technologies

    All our clouds are certified 100% buzzy

    What's the buzz around FizzBuzz?


- Hint: Google online how to do this! Try searching for "Unordered list in
  HTML". A lot of coding involves Googling for answers, this an important best
  skill to learn.

- Bonus: Change it into an ordered (numbered) list with two tiny changes!



Bonus Challenge #1: Image link
-------------------------------

- Make the cat image itself a link, so when you click on it it takes you to a
  new page

- For example, make it a link to the Wikipedia article on cats in your native
  language

- Extra Bonus: Research how to make it open the link in a new browser tab
  instead of replacing the current browser tab




Bonus Challenge #2: Table
---------------------------

- Look up the HTML code necessary for tables

- Create a table with the following information:


|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Name         | Description          | Date created |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Python       | Programming language | 1990         |
| HTML         | Markup language      | 1993         |
| JavaScript   | Programming language | 1995         |
| CSS          | Styling language     | 1996         |
| Django       | Backend framework    | 2005         |
| Bootstrap    | CSS framework        | 2011         |
| React.js     | Frontend framework   | 2013         |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|
