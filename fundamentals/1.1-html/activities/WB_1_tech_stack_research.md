ACTIVITY: Two Horses and A Unicorn
-------------------------------------

**How to do activities**

- This activity, like all other activities in this course, is divided into a
  series of challenges.

- Give yourself a time-limit: If you are following online, or in class, use the
  time suggested. Otherwise, set a 10 or 15 minute timer. Your goal is to
  finish as many challenges as you can within a certain amount of time.

- Focus first on the first challenges. Do them one at a time.

- If you run out of time -- which you probably will -- skip to the next
  activity. Later, such as the next day, set aside time to return to activities
  to review concepts at a slower pace and dive deeper.

- Remember: Focus first on breadth, then on depth. Sometimes the best thing to
  do is to move on!

Background: A "tech stack" is all the programming languages and associated
tools that are put into use at a particular company or organization. Choosing a
"tech stack" when starting a new project is a mixture of personal preference,
familiarity, and also selecting the right tool for the job.

1. Bring up your preferred text-editor
    - Don't have one?
        - macOS: Download VS Code from the site: https://code.visualstudio.com
        - Linux: Get VS Code by searching for it in the Software Center
    - Not sure how to start it?
        - macOS: Press Command + Space, then type in "VS Code"
        - Linux: Go to your application menu or application search bar (the
          dots on the bottom left), and type in VS Code

2. In your web-browser, research two companies and the tech stack they use. Use
any or all of the following websites:
    - Stack Share
        - Look up the stack of companies here: https://stackshare.io/stacks
    - The most recent Hacker News "Who is Hiring" thread
        - Google: https://www.google.com/search?q=hacker+news+who+is+hiring
        - Browse through the different positions and languages / frameworks
          they use

3. Type into your text-editor the names of the various languages and
technologies your two chosen companies use

3. Save the file as `tech_stack_research.txt`
    - Make sure to save it some place memorable, such as your Desktop
    - Hint: Notice we don't use spaces in file names while coding, and we keep
      everything lowercase. This is a good habit to get into now!



Challenge #2: Invent a Unicorn
---------------------------------

# WB: Friction Technologies (ML for fitness)
- Django
- Python
- Mojo
- OpenCV
- Postgres
- Riak
- Redis
- Celery
- Docker
- Google Cloud
- Github Actions
- Fluxcd
- React
- TypeScript
- next.js


Now, a fun challenge: Invent a made-up tech company.  Throughout the next
activities, we'll be building a website for this invented company!

1. Come up with a name. (For example, "Fizzbuzz Cloud Technologies")

2. Choose a "tech stack" for it. (For example, what's taught in this course!)



Bonus Challenge: 
---------------------------------

A unicorn is Silicon Valley slang for a start-up that "comes out of
nowhere" and is valued for massive amounts of money (such as a billion).
Generate a logo for your "unicorn" company using one of the free online
logo generators available.
