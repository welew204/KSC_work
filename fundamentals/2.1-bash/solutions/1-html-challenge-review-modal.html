                    <p class="snazzy-para">Shiba Inu. It is similar to the Akita, though much smaller in
                    stature. The Shiba Inu (柴犬) is the smallest of the six original and
                    distinct spitz breeds of dog from Japan. A small, agile dog that copes
                    very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally bred
                    for hunting.</p>

                    <p>Inu is the Japanese word for dog, but the origin of the prefix
                    "Shiba" is less clear. The word shiba means "brushwood" in Japanese,
                    and refers to a type of tree or shrub whose leaves turn red in the
                    fall. This leads some to believe that the Shiba was named with this in
                    mind, either because the dogs were used to hunt in wild shrubs, or
                    because the most common color of the Shiba Inu is a red color similar
                    to that of the shrubs. However, in an old Nagano dialect, the word
                    shiba also had the meaning of "small", thus this might be a reference
                    to the dog's diminutive stature. Therefore, the Shiba Inu is sometimes
                    translated as "Little Brushwood Dog".</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <p class="snazzy-para">Shibas tend to exhibit an independent nature and sometimes show
                    aggression. This is more prevalent among female Shibas and is
                    influenced by the breed's strong prey drive. The Shiba Inu is best in a
                    home without other small dogs or young children, but consistent
                    obedience training and early socialization can make all the difference.
                    The breed also interacts fairly well with cats.</p>
