Using your terminal, solve the following challenges.

Challenge 1:
------------------

Use cat and file redirection to combine the JabberWocky poem into a single text
file.

As a hint, here are some commands that will include the first two parts. Can
you modify them and use them to include the last?

    cd 1-jabberwocky/
    cat jabberwocky_a.txt jabberwocky_b.txt > full_poem.txt




Challenge 2:
------------------

1. Using your file-browser, look inside the 2-html-site directory for this
challenge. Investigate the "content" and "templates" directory.

2. Explain in your own words what these files mean. Try to deduce what you
think might be represented by the files located in these directories.

* Hint #1: They are some sort of "deconstructed" website

* Hint #2: If reconstructed correctly, it will look like the example solution
  for HW 1


Challenge 3:
------------------

See if you can craft a series of "cat" shell commands, redirecting the results
into a files, in order to re-construct the pages. In the end, you should have
the HTML for a functioning website built.

This is a hard one! We only gave you a few clues.
# DONE

BONUS
------------------

1. Make a new directory called "docs"

2. Re-do challenge 3, except make the output go into this directory

3. What doesn't work this way? What might you have to move into the docs
directory?
