# 5 reps of...

1. `cd` into `/tmp`

2. `ls`

3. Create an empty directory named `rep0`

4. `cd` into the newly created directory

5. Use `touch` to create a new file named `file.txt`

6. `cd` back to the `activities/2-cli-challenge` directory (wherever
this file is).

7. `ls`

8. Repeat, except for step #3 increase the number by one, e.g. `rep1`,
`rep2` `rep3`, etc

BONUS: Try again, except for each step, use `echo` to pipe the words
"repetition 1" into rep1 etc. Can you do 5 reps in less than a minute?
