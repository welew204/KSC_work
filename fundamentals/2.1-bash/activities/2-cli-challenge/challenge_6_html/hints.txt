To create an empty file on either Linux or macOS:

    touch my_file.html


To open a file in your browser from the terminal (in this case, named
my_file.html):

Linux:
    xdg-open my_file.html

macOS:
    open my_file.html




To open a file in your text-editor:

If you are using Text Editor (gedit) on Linux:
    gedit my_file.html

If you are using VS Code:
    code my_file.html




If the above commands are giving you trouble, consider just opening the
current directory in finder or the file browser, and then opening the
individual files the "normal" (graphical) way:

Linux:
    xdg-open .

macOS:
    open .
