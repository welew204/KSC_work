            <h1>A bit about me</h1>
            <p>Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Isn't that fantastic?
            You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Clouds
            are free they come and go as they please. In nature, dead trees are
            just as normal as live trees.</p>

            <p>Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world;
            you become a tiger. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to
            worry about it. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have
            big clouds.</p>

            <p>If you hypnotize it, it will go away. It's beautiful - and we
            haven't even done anything to it yet. We tell people sometimes:
            we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody
            absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you
            addicted. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. You could sit
            here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you
            could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. And I will
            hypnotize that just a little bit.</p>

            <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be
            individuals. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild.
            Fluff that up. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you
            can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. I
            thought today we would do a happy little picture.</p>

            <p>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals.
            That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. It's a very
            cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me
            to death. You gotta think like a tree. Nothing wrong with washing
            your brush.</p>

            <p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. You
            can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have
            that power. We'll lay all these little funky little things in
            there. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Trees
            cover up a multitude of sins. I thought today we would make a happy
            little stream that's just running through the woods here.</p>

            <p>Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have
            fun. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just
            keep going and expect it will get better. If you overwork it you
            become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud
            killer.</p>
