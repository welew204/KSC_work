Chapter 3

When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto
attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for
the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with
other customs than those of my native country. My departure was
therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could
arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurredâ€”an omen, as it were, of
my future misery.
