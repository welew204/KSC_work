This is a non-coding activity. The goal is to strengthen your Object Oriented
Programming planning skills by drawing diagrams that show what properties and
methods are in a class, and the relationship between classes.

Using a pen and paper (or a graphical tool, such as the free/open source
application Dia), diagram the following:

* Students (think about: students, courses, assignments)

* Employees at a corporation (think about: employees, managers, positions,
  unfilled positions)

* Twitter (think about: users, tweets, follows)

* GitHub (think about: users, repos, pull requests)

* Netflix (think about: movies, TV series, users, who watched what,
  preferences)

Dia is a somewhat old-school (but free/open source) diagramming tool for
flow-charts. It's very simple, but gets the job done. This is the only time
you'll be using it in this course, so you'd probably be better off just using
pen and paper or a general purpose drawing application. However, if you are
curious, you can install it like this:

- **Ubuntu GNU/Linux:** `sudo apt-get install dia`
- **macOS:** `brew cask install dia`
