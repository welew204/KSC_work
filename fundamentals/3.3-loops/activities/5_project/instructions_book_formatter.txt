BOOK STATIC SITE GENERATOR

Create a static site generator that inputs a book's text from Project
Gutenberg, and generates a chapter-by-chapter HTML version of that text.
An example of the text is provided ("great_expectations.txt")

- Role 1: Pure front-end role! Pick this if you want more practice with
  HTML and CSS. Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, etc, design a nice looking
  page to display text. Keep in mind time limits and limitations of the
  application.
    - Collaboration hint: Think of ways to begin work on this before
      your teammates are finished, such as for now just using hard-coded
      text to test it.

- Role 2: Input "parser". Parsing is taking an input file (string) and
  transforming it into data structures such as lists or dicts. Write a
  code that inputs text from a file, "parses" it into appropriate data
  types (for example, you might consider using a "list" of strings to
  store the paragraphs).
    - Collaboration hint: Before you combine your work with your
      teammates work, just print the data structure to the terminal to
      double check the data is getting passed correctly.

- Role 3: Output templating. Templating is combining data in variables
  with strings to generate HTML and CSS, essentially "prettifying" the
  data. Your goal is to write code that takes the data from Role 2, and
  the HTML from Role 1, and transforms it into assembled HTML pages.
    - Collaboration hint: Think of ways you can work on this before the
      others are done. For example, write code that loops through test
      data, and outputs "h2" and "p" tags as needed.
