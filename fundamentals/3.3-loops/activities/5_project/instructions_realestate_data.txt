REAL-ESTATE DATA STATISTICS

Your goal is to make a data reading application that loads data from a
CSV file.  There is an example CSV file provided to use.

- Role 1: UI. Write functions or code that have menus that ask the user
  what they want to do. You'll be using loops and "inputs" to construct
  a text-based menu.
    - Collaboration hint: Think of ways to begin work on this before
      your teammates are finished, such as for now having placeholder
      functions for the other functionality that get filled in later.

- Role 2: Input parser. Write a function to read in data from a CSV
  file, "parse it", and put it into an appropriate data type, such as a
  list or dict.
    - Collaboration hint: Before you combine your work with your
      teammates work, just print the data structure to the terminal to
      double check the data is getting passed correctly.

- Role 3: Data crunching. Write a functions that take in a list of data,
  and determines max, min, mean, mode, median, and other such statistics
  for the data. Use Google to learn how to do these different
  statistical operations on data using Python 3, and look for easier
  solutions for each.
    - Collaboration hint: Think of ways you can work on this before the
      others are done. For example, write code that operates on test or
      example data.
