Lightning Projects with Python

    Working by yourself? Check out "instructions_solo.md"

Now you will have your first "lightning project" in the course. This
goal of this activity will be to get practice planning and divvying up
work between multiple people, and reading specifications to figure out
the work necessary in a short amount of time. It is the first practice
you will get with group work.

1. Form your group. Groups should be 3-4 people. If you have 2 people,
merge with another group. Groups will be randomly assigned.

2. Agree on one of the two following challenges: a static site generator
for books, or a real-estate data processing applications. (Details are
included in separate txt files)

3. Choose between the roles. If you have more people than roles, two
people should work on the same role.

Hints:

- You will likely not finish the entire application during class time.

- Instead, your goal should be to at least finish planning and
  brainstorming, and have enough time for individual team members to at
  least start work on each of the different pieces.

- Pseudocode and state diagrams will be your friends.

- Don't worry about properly setting up git to collaborate -- that can
  take too much time.

- When class time is soon to be over, all team members should send their
  code snippets to one person to combine them.

- One of the most challenging aspects of collaborating is learning how
  to isolate and work on your part of a project while other people are
  still working on theirs. Think about how to use "fake" test data and
  print to ensure your piece is working correctly.
