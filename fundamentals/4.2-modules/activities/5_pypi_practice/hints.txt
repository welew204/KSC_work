Here are some hints for getting packages running. Ultimately, running
packages is a matter of dealing with all manner of inconsistencies,
stemming from the fact that PyPI packages vary wildly in quality. So,
some of them have really good documentation, meaning you can easily
integrate them into your project, or others may have more challenging or
sparse documentation, meaning you'll have to do a bit more work (and a
lot of head-scratching!) to figure out how they work.

In this activity we try a couple random packages for practice. The hints
below might be helpful if you get stuck trying to fix the documentation
provided.





Challenge #2:
----------------

- If you are having trouble finding the "docs" (documentation) for this
  package, they can be found here:
    - <https://robpol86.github.io/terminaltables/>

- This project is older -- it was first "abandoned" by its original
  developer, and then "adopted" by another developer.

- The usage notes on this project is slightly off, and for an older
  version of python!

- Still having trouble getting the project working? Try replacing the
  broken print example with this instead, which will work with Python 3:

    print(table.table)



When added with the example code:


    from terminaltables import AsciiTable
    table_data = [
        ['Heading1', 'Heading2'],
        ['row1 column1', 'row1 column2'],
        ['row2 column1', 'row2 column2'],
        ['row3 column1', 'row3 column2'],
    ]
    table = AsciiTable(table_data)
    print(table.table)




Challenge #3:
----------------

- If you are having trouble finding the "docs" (documentation) for this
  package, they can be found here:
    - <https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

- Having an issue with the line that creates an image? Consider deleting
  that line that references images:


    # This causes an error if no image exists with this name
    document.add_picture('monty-truth.png', width=Inches(1.25))
