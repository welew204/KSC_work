Follow our Pipenv getting started guide:

https://github.com/kickstartcoding/pipenv-getting-started

Summary is included below:

-----

1. Install pipenv

Linux users, run the following command:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y && sudo pip3 install pipenv

macOS users, run the following command:

    brew install pipenv


2. In a terminal, create a new directory for this activity. You can
place it anywhere. Change into the directory for the subsequent steps.
This will be a "pipenv project directory".


3. Create a Pipfile along with a new pipenv "virtualenv" as follows:

    pipenv --python 3


4. Activate the "virtualenv" so that you can start installing PyPI
packages:

    pipenv shell


5. Now that you are "in" your new shell, install a package. As an
example, you can use is "silly". Once you have activated the virtualenv,
you can install it with:

    pipenv install silly


6. Try using silly.  Test it out with the following in a Python file:

    import silly
    print(silly.thing())
    print(silly.paragraph())


7. Try out all the features of silly! Read more about the silly package

Bonus Challenge:

1. Look through PyPI for another package

2. Try installing it with pipenv

3. Read its documentation and see if you can get it working
