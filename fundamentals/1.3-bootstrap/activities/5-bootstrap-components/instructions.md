Get practice with trying out different components and utility classes from the
Bootstrap 5 documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/

Challenge #1
------------
# DONE

Replace the H1 tag with a div like this `<div class="p-5 mb-4 bg-light rounded-3">` 
inside of the container. Inside of that div, add an alert (see "Alerts")
 and breadcrumbs (see "Breadcrumb").


Challenge #2
------------
# DONE

Add a navbar above this container (see "Navbar"). Use the "dark" variant.
Bonus: Put a "container" div inside of the navbar to make the contents
generally line up with the rest of the content, while the background of the navbar is
the full-width of the screen.


Challenge #3
------------
# DONE

Add a button group inside the main content (see "Button
group"). Have each button in button group be a different color (see
"Button" for the colors / styles available). Make them the same size as the
original button in the big headline section at the top of the page.


Challenge #4
------------

Try out the various utility classes (See "Utilities" under Components).  Add a
"Larger shadow" (see "Shadows") and a "3-level" margin (see "Spacing", hint
"m-3"), and finally a green success border circular border (see "Border").

Use the following img as a start:

    <img src="https://picsum.photos/id/330/300/300.jpg" />

Bonus Challenges
----------------

Currently, the JavaScript isn't loaded for Bootstrap. This is required for some
of the more advanced components that have interaction. Research & paste in the
script tag that loads the JavaScript (traditionally put just before the
`</body>` tag). Once you do that, try the following:

1. Create a Carousel component with controls, containing the following four
images:

2. Search for a fun novelty Lorem Ipsum generator. Generate 4 paragraphs of
text. Create a Nav Tabs component with 4 tabs (see "Navs"), and put one
paragraph in each tab so that you can click on each of the 4 tabs to see a
different paragraph.  Hint: You may need to adjust "id" and "href" attributes.

3. Using the same paragraphs you generated, create 4 separate modals (under
Modals), each one opened by a separate button, with differing titles and
content.

Hint: You'll need to copy the modal code 4 times, adjusting the "id" and
"data-target" attributes for each one.
