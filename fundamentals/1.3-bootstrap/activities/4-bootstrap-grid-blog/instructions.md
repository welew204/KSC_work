In this activity, we will be using Bootstrap to style a blog page, featuring
the painter Bob Ross.

The goal of this activity is to get your website looking like the screenshot
found in clues/blogsolution.jpg


Challenge 1
-----------
# DONE
Start with a wireframe: A wireframe consists of creating a line-drawing of how
you want to structure your site. Either using a pen & paper, or a software that
you're comfortable with, sketch out the structure that you see in the image
file "clues/blogsolution.jpg". Try sketching your wireframe first, before
checking the hints at the bottom of this file.


Challenge 2
-----------
# DONE
Starting with the "outer-grid", arrange the (left) sidebar and (right) main
content using a bootstrap grid.  Don't worry about arranging each blog post
(will do in next challenge).


Challenge 3
-----------
# DONE
Now that you have the basic outer-grid structure in place, time to work on the
inner grid(s) of the blog posts. For each blog post, add enough rows and
columns to format it as you see it in the picture.







Challenge 1 Hints
-----------------

- Hint 1: Don't add extra rows that you don't need. By default content will
  "stack" vertically, so no need to add rows if you are only going to have 1
  column in each row.

- Hint 2: The solution involves a very simple "outer grid" that arranges the
  sidebar and main-content area, and then several "inner grids" for each blog
  post.

- Hint 3: The outer wireframe might look something like this

- Hint 4: The inner wireframe for each blog post might look something like this


        --------------------
