<p class="my-cool-paragraph">In another moment down went Alice after it, never
once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>

<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped
suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping
herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.</p>

<p class="my-cool-paragraph">"Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a
fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll
all think me at home!"</p>

<div>
    <p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
    Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
    door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get
    out again.</p>
</div>

<p id="the-final-paragraph">Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table,
all made of solid glass.</p>
