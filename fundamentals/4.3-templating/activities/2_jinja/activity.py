# Challenge 1:
# 1. As with the previous activity, create a new virtualenv using pipenv
# 2. Enter into that virtualenv
# 3. Install jinja2
# 4. Examine the following code. See if you can explain in your own words what
# every line is doing. Change the name to be your name.


template = Template('Hello, {{ name }}!')
result = template.render({
    'name': 'Joan',
})
# print(result)

# Challenge 2:
# Using Challenge 1 as a clue, write the code to utilize this template to
# render your own name, favorite color, favorite food, and favorite book.

print('Challenge 3 -------------')
# Challenge 3:
# 1. Uncomment the print function invocation.
# 2. By only modifying the template code string, replace the question marks to
# add the template variables necessary to categorize the foods (do not modify
# the invocation).
# The first done is done for you.

print('Challenge 4 -------------')
# Challenge 4:
# 1. Uncomment the print function invocation.
# 2. Add key / value pairs to the context dictionary to cause the template
# rendering process to render the HTML to a simple website, with a title,
# a single blog post title, and a single "lead-in" to a blog-post

# Hint 1: Only modify the "context" dictionary!
# Hint 2: Look for plural / singular as a clue of data types. You'll be using
# strings and lists for this activity.
# Hint 3: You might find helpful this description of built-in filters:
