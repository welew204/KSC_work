For this activity, you will be making a series of alteration to this Kitty City
website until it resembles the mockup.jpg "solution".

- You should ONLY be altering the CSS -- don't touch the HTML.
- Don't worry about strictly following "BEM" while doing this activity.


Challenge 1: Code Comprehension
----------------------------------

Explain in your own words:
- Can you explain what the "variables" prefixed with -- are doing?

>>>they are set to be used in later properties

- Can you explain why the CSS classes are named the way they are?
>>> as defined in the html



Challenge 2: Pseudo-classes
----------------------------------

- Add CSS to make every other list item have a gray background.
- HINT: Look up ":nth-of-type(odd)" pseudo-selector


Challenge 3: Pseudo-classes
----------------------------------

- Make the first list item have no bullet point, have a larger font, and have
  the same color as the header elements using the CSS variable.
- HINT: Look up ":first-child" pseudo-selector


Challenge 4: Pseudo-elements
----------------------------------

- Make each paragraph have "small-caps" for the first line, and have the first
  letter be much bigger ("drop caps" effect).
- HINT: Look up ":first-letter" and ":first-line" pseudo-selectors. For
  the "small-caps" effect, use "font-variant: small-caps"


Bonus Challenge 1: Pseudo-elements
----------------------------------

- Time to style some "pull-quote" style blockquotes! Make each "lead"
  (sub-header below each headline) be in large curly, double quotation marks
  which are white. Make the lead itself be in a gray block.
- Hint: Using "::before" and "::after" avoids the need for any HTML changes.


Bonus Challenge 2: Counters
----------------------------------

- Use CSS Counters to make headlines start with "Article #1", "Article #2" etc,
  with numbers that count up.
- Hint: With CSS counters, it can be done entirely with CSS, no HTML changes.
