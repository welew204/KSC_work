                <p>Of course he's a happy little bob ross, cause we don't have
                any other kind. Go out on a limb - that's where the Little Ross
                is. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke
                brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>

                <p>Now let's put some happy little bob ross in here. Let all
                these things just sort of happen. Just think about these things
                in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>

                <p>You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things
                in here. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing
                here. All kinds of happy little bob ross. This is your world.
                Bob Rosses cover up a multitude of sins.</p>
