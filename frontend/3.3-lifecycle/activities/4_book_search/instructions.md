Your challenge is to build a book searching application, almost entirely from
scratch. Some example HTML (in the form of JSX) and CSS is provided for you, so
you can focus on the JavaScript logic and structure.

See the completed application here:

General tips:

* Start with a previous activity

* Copy over the given App.js and App.css starter code to get a head start.

* Play around with the Open Library API.
  - Hint: http://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=lord+of+the+rings&limit=10&offset=0

* Research their cover API.
  - Hint: http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8069767-M.jpg
  - The number can be replaced by an ID you get back from their API.

* This is **hard** -- so be sure to start small, experiment, and focus on
  getting one thing working at a time

* Don't try to do everything at once. Do one thing at a time:
    1. Your first goal should just be successfully fetching data and
    console.log'ing it
    2. Your next goal, displaying it with JSX + HTML
    3. etc.

* Never start from scratch: Always copy code!
