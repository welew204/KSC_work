## Useful for teamwork

* Styleguidist
    * Style guides are what designers and front-end engineers use to specify a
      websites branding and style.
    * Styleguidist is a plugin that auto-generates a "catalog" of style from
      your react code. Not useful to you now, but very cool in larger
      organizations!
