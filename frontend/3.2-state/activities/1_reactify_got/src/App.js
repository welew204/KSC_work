            maintenance, but is also capable of taking down an immortal White
            Walker. The metal is easily identified by its distinctive rippled
            pattern.

            Ice was the official sword of the Lord of Winterfell, forged from
            Valyrian steel and handed down over the ages. After being used to
            behead Ned Stark at the end of Season 1, it was subsequently melted
            down to forge two new swords â€“ the Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail.
