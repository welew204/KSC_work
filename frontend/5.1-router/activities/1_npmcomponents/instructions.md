# NPM Component Practice

- Get started as before: either `npm install`, or copying a previous
  `node_modules`, then running the server with `npm run start`



Challenge #1: React Day Picker
------------------------------------------------

1. Look up React Day Picker: <https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker>

2. Install a copy of it into your node modules:

        npm install react-day-picker

3. Get an example of it working in your App.js


Challenge #2: React Color picker
------------------------------------------------

Rinse and repeat Challenge #1, except for `react-color`:

- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-color>



Challenge #3: React Select
------------------------------------------------

Same as above steps, but for `react-select`:

- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select>

- NOTE: This time it's trickier, since the documentation uses the class / OOP
  style syntax. See the "React Class to Function" guide for help!




Challenge #4: VictoryChart
------------------------------------------------

VictoryChart is an relatively easy to use and sophisticated data visualization
library for React. Can you follow the documentation to get one of their
examples working?

Bonus Challenge #1: Ant Design Widget Library
------------------------------------------------

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd

* Read a bit about the Ant Design suite of components and design library
  (comparable to the Bootstrap component library)

* This one is a bit harder, as you need to add a line to your CSS, also. Take a
  look at the guide here:
  https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app

* Try getting a variety of their components working, including unusual ones
  like Tree or Timeline:
    https://ant.design/components/tree/
    https://ant.design/components/timeline/



Bonus Challenge #2: React Date Picker
------------------------------------------------

- Read a little about either the following React Date Pickers:
    * <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-date-picker>
    * More info here: <http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-date-picker/>
    * <https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker>

- Get an example of these working in your App.js
