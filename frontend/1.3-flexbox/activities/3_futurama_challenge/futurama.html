                <p>But existing is basically all I do! Moving alongâ€¦ Ah, yes! John
                    Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he
                    pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>

                <p>Does anybody else feel jealous and worried? <strong> You
                        are the last hope of the universe.</strong> <em> In your time,

                    he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a
