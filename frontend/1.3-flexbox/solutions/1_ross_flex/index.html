                <p>Of course he's a happy little bob ross, cause we don't have
                any other kind. Go out on a limb - that's where the Little Ross
                is. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke
                brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>
                <img src="img/tree_landscape.png" class="ArticleImage" />

                <p>Now let's put some happy little bob ross in here. Let all
                these things just sort of happen. Just think about these things
                in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>

                <p>You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things
                in here. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing
                here. All kinds of happy little bob ross. This is your world.
                Bob Rosses cover up a multitude of sins.</p>

                <p>Let your imagination be your guide. Making all those little
                bob fluffies that live in the clouds. Poor old Bob Ross. Mix your
                color marbly don't mix it dead. You can create anything that
                makes you happy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking
                about what you're doing, you just let it happen.</p>

                <p>I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch
                of bob Prussian blue Use what you see, don't plan it. Bob Rosses
                get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.</p>

                <p>There's nothing wrong with having a bob ross as a friend. So
                often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of
                fun. This bob is unplanned it really just happens. Bob Rosses grow
                in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not
                every Bob is perfect. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This
                should make you happy. With something so strong, a little bit
                can go a long way.</p>

                <p>We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just
                here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the
                world.  That is when you can experience true joy, when you have
                no fear. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.
                The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our
                heart.</p>
