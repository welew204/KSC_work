Complete the desk calculator, on your own!

For this challenge we, won't give you many hints. The components are built
for you, but none of the buttons actually do anything. You will need to
hook up the events and logic.

We will, however, give you a meta hint. This is advice that will apply to all
your future coding endeavors:

1. Think about previous activities. What sort of steps should you always take
first when approaching a new challenge?

2. What is a good, intermediate goal to set for yourself? (A hint below)

3. Think about applying each of the following tools:
    - Pseudocode
    - State-diagrams (VERY useful for React! It's why we learned them)
    - Component wireframe

4. MOST IMPORTANTLY, start writing code! Don't just stare at it. Change
something, experiment, and see what happens. Just be careful to not change too
much at once, and always have your finger on the "undo" button :)




Hint: If you are truly at a loss as to an intermediate goal for the calculator,
a reasonable one would be completing the "adding number" functionality.
