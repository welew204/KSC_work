5.3-mern Extra Activities
---------------------------------

*Note:* Only try these activities if you have already completed all the
previous activities, and want even more practice with the MERN stack!

The current activities represent the best way to learn this material for the
first time. These extra 3 MERN activities represent earlier versions of today's
lesson, which go in different direction with building up step-by-step a
Pokemon-themed game. After teaching these earlier version a couple times, we
realized they were not as useful as they could be, and students needed a more
direct approach with more practical examples. This is why we rewrote this
lesson with the example projects and activities that are the current version of
today's lesson.



Ordering
--------------------------

These old activities explore the MERN stack in the following order:

1. Mongo (activity 1 - same as the one you did, did not change)
2. Node + Mongo ("extra" activity 2 -- Showing how to load and interact with
  data with just node, mongo, and the commandline)
3. Express + Node + Mongo ("extra" activity 3 -- Showing how to combine Express,
  Node, and Mongo to build a simple API server)
4. React + Express + Node + Mongo ("extra" activity 4 -- Showing how to create a
  frontend in React to interact with the backend create in Activity 3)
