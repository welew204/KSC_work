Hackathon: Lightning Projects with JavaScript & APIs

NOTE: Working with other people? Use the `group_instructions` file instead.


Lightning Front-end API Projects
------------------------------------

1. Pick one or two different APIs. Note that you are limited in your choices
because you can only select front-end friendly APIs (see `cors_info.md`)
    - A huge list of public APIs is here, but you can use whatever:
    - <https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis>

2. Design an application that uses these APIs. Consider throwing together
super-simple wireframe sketches. If you can't quickly think of an application
and APIs, consider going with one of the suggestions in `example_ideas.md`

3. Plan your work by figuring out what has to be done in the following
categories: API work, design work, and front-end engineering work.

4. Get to work! The work for each of the phases is explained below.



API Engineer
------------------------------------

- Your goal is to get a "proof of concept" for the API working so that it
  fetches the desired necessary data using the JavaScript Fetch API package.
- You may need to sign-up to gain access to some of the APIs.
- When working on the API, don't worry about the styling or DOM aspects just
  yet. Just make sure you are getting the right information for your project
  and console.log'ing it to prove it.
- If you can get a single proof of concept working with the browser, feel free
  to start using this for the front-end development. You can use this data as
  "dummy data" to get started with integrating everything, only dropping in
  your requests code when the time comes.
- Consider putting your API code into a function that cleanly retrieves the
  data you need from the API.




Front-end designer
------------------------------------

- Using CSS and HTML, create a design for your project. While focusing on this,
  just include placeholder content for now.
- Use CSS grid to get all your placeholders in the right spots.
- Feel free to look up flashy CSS tricks or animations online and see if you
  can integrate them,
- Also feel free to find stylish and modern CSS libraries or templates to
  integrate or start with.



Front-end engineer
------------------------------------

- Your goal is to tie everything together with DOM manipulation and logic
- If you start on this before you get the API data figured out, consider
  focusing first on creating code to generate DOM elements with dummy data
