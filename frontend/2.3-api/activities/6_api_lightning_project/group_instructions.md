Hackathon: Lightning Projects with JavaScript & APIs

NOTE: Working by yourself? Check out the `solo_instructions` file instead.


Lightning Front-end API Projects
------------------------------------

1. Form your group. 3-4 people is ideal for a Hackathon project, but any number
of people 2-5 can work!

2. Agree on 1-2 different APIs. Note that you are limited in your choices
because you can only select front-end friendly APIs (see `cords_info.md`).
    - A huge list of public APIs is here, but you can use whatever:
    - <https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis>

3. Agree on an application that uses these APIs. If you can't quickly agree on
an application and APIs, go with a suggestions in `example_ideas.md`

4. Form into the following roles: 1-2 API engineers (one for each APIs),
front-end designer, and front-end engineer. Its okay to be flexible and switch
up the exact work you are doing, even if you are assigned to a certain role.

5. Get to work! The work for each of the roles is explained below.



API Engineer
------------------------------------

- You may need to sign-up to gain access to some of the APIs.
- Your goal is to get a "proof of concept" for the API working so that it
  fetches the desired necessary data using the JavaScript Fetch API package.
- Don't worry about the styling or DOM aspects. Just make sure you are getting
  the right information for your project and console.log'ing it to prove it.
- If you can get a single proof of concept working with the browser, go ahead
  and send the resulting data over to the front-end developer.  They can use
  this data as "dummy data" to get started with integrating everything, only
  dropping your requests code when the time comes.
- If you have time, put your API code into a function that cleanly retrieves
  the data from the website.




Front-end designer
------------------------------------

- Using CSS and HTML only, create a design for your project. Just include
  placeholder content for now.
- Use CSS grid to get all your placeholders in the right spots.
- Feel free to look up flashy CSS tricks or animations online and see if you
  can integrate them,
- Also feel free to find stylish and modern CSS libraries or templates to
  integrate or start with. (Just don't use Bootstrap! That's no longer cool
  enough.)



Front-end engineer
------------------------------------

- Your goal is to tie everything together with DOM manipulation and logic
- Start with a plain HTML file, or one of our previous activities solutions.
- Work closely with the Designer to ensure you are creating elements with the
  right classes so they get styled correctly.
- Work closely with the API engineer(s) to get demo data set up in lieu of the
  complete project working.
- Since it will take some time to get the data from the API engineers, just
  create code to generate DOM elements with dummy data at first
