NOTE: The `solo_instructions` and `group_instructions` files are where you
start. This file only contains supplemental information.

If you are having trouble deciding, then consider the following ideas:

Example idea #1: Movie GIF search engine
------------------------------------------------------------

- Using the OMDB API and the Giphy API, create a site that searches for
  information about movies, and then inundates the user with GIFs related to
  that movie title (pulled from Giphy)
- It should show at least the run-time and year, and perhaps some other
  information about the movie such as top actors and movie poster
- More features might also include ability to click on an actor's name, and
  search for GIF's about that actor
- Feel free to use this API Key for OMDB: 187a5752


Example idea #2: Map search with extra info
------------------------------------------------------------

- Using either Mapbox or Google Maps, create an embedded searchable map
- Whenever a place is looked up, add extra information on the side - this could
  be Gifs (Giphy), information about movies (OMDB), weather, or any other
  Public APIs
