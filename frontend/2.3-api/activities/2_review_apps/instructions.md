Can you develop one of the following applications from scratch?

All of them have been done in one form or another in previous activities. The
goal here is to see how much you remember that you can do these from scratch.
Some starter HTML has been written for you for each of these, but you will
likely need to modify it in different ways, such as adding IDs, onClick events,
etc



JavaScript Counter
-----------------------------------------------

- Click on a button to increment a variable. Display the variable in the DOM.
- Get another counter going with a separate tally

- (Bonus Challenge) Stretch Goals:
    1. Add more buttons to count in different increments (such as +10)
    2. Generate the counters using JavaScript from an array of objects

- Stuck? JS from a previous activity in hints.js



JavaScript Trivia Game
-----------------------------------------------

- When the user clicks on an answer, attach onClick events that (somehow)
  display "Correct", or "Wrong" (and then display the correct answer)
- Once you get that working, make it display in the DOM, and remove the ability
  to answer again (such as by clearing the buttons)
- (Bonus Challenge) Stretch Goals:
    1. Keep track of correct and wrong answers
    2. Generate the questions using JavaScript from an array of objects

- Stuck? JS + HTML from a previous activity in hints.js



JavaScript To-Do App
-----------------------------------------------

- Add items to a to-do list using an input.
- (Bonus Challenge) Stretch Goals:
    1. Allow deletion of items via a button
    2. Store & retrieve to-do list via localStorage

- Stuck? JS from a previous activity in hints.js



Extra: JavaScript Arithmetic Quiz
-----------------------------------------------

We haven't done anything like this! Write a "Arithmetic Quiz" to learn basic
arithmetic operation. You might want to imagine the intended audience are
children first learning math, and/or adults looking for a challenge to improve
their mental calculations!

- Randomly select 2 numbers.
- If the user correctly enters their sum, display "Correct!" otherwise display
  "Wrong!" and show the correct answer
- (Bonus Challenge) Stretch Goals:
    1. Randomly select subtraction or multiplication, also
    2. Check answer as the user types, and highlight in red or green colors if
    wrong or correct, immediately going on to the next one when correct
    3. Add a timer, and keep track of wrong and right answers
    4. Randomly show long division, including also blank for remainder
- Extra Bonus: Randomize what is left blank, e.g. `3 + ____ = 10` (tricky!)
