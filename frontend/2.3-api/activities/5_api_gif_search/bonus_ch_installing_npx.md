Installing and Configuring Node & NPM
-----------------------------------------------------

Background: Node and NPM are applications that developers use later for
developing React.js-based applications. This activity does not use React.js,
but instead is in "plain vanilla JS". However, Node & NPM do provide a
convenient test-server to use during development.


Checking versions
-----------------------------------------------------

Ensure you have Node and NPM by running each of the following commands:

    node --version
    npm --version
    npx --version


Installing
-----------------------------------------------------

If you get a "command not found" error for any of these, that means you don't
have node or npm installed. Here's how to install NPM, NPX, and Node on macOS
and Ubuntu GNU/Linux:

- Ubuntu Linux:


    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    sudo npm install -g npx


- macOS:


    brew install node
