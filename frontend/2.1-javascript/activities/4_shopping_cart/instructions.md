In this scenario, you are a new-hire taking over work from another developer.
The other developer had started writing a shopping cart / "point of sale"
JavaScript application for a small organic grocery store, but didn't finish.

Complete the code to make a functioning shopping cart app. This will require
making changes both HTML and JavaScript. This is an open-ended activity with no
steps or further hints.


Specification
-----------------

- Clicking on one of the "buy" buttons should "add it" to the cart on the right
- When "Get receipt" is clicked, display an alert showing the quantity of each
  item, along with the total cost (sum in dollars) of all items
- Need more clues on what to build? Try out the solution in your browser (avoid
  peaking at the code!): `solutions/4_shopping_cart/index.html`

When you're done with these specifications, check out `bonus_instructions.md`
for further specifications.
